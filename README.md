## About Me

I am Paul (he/him), a Bachelor's student in Technical Computer Science at TH Köln, Germany with a strong focus on networks, distributed systems, and software engineering.
Before my studies, I worked for 15 years as a professional photographer, developing a keen eye for precision and detail – skills that now inform my approach to software development.  

My academic path reflects my passion for problem-solving, security, and technology.  
I enjoy designing robust systems, working across the full stack, and collaborating in diverse teams.  
I am particularly interested in cybersecurity, critical infrastructure protection, and the intersection of hardware and software.

## Selected University Projects

As part of my Bachelor's degree in Technical Computer Science at TH Köln, I worked on several hands-on projects that combined software development, system design, and teamwork.  
Below are two examples that highlight my skills in full-stack development, backend design, mobile app development, and project coordination.

*(I’m currently preparing and documenting my projects for release)*

### MathGoesRetro
Full-stack educational game platform (**Node.js**, **Supabase/PostgreSQL**, **JavaScript**, **Python**).  
Member of a 4-person team, additionally serving as team spokesperson responsible for coordination and communication.  
Developed the central game engine including 2D graphics rendering, collision detection, input handling, C64-style as well as integrated Python-generated math tasks for the game.  
Backend implemented as a REST API with an entity-based data model, high score tracking, and level unlocking.  
Mobile-first frontend with both touch and keyboard controls.

### Traffic Counter App
Android application for recording and analyzing traffic data (**Kotlin**, **Jetpack Compose**, **Room-DB**).
